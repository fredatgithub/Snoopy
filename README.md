# Snoopy

Project Description
This app is a code repository where you can store your wonderful code snippets or part of code.

As a developper, I hate to create again and again something I've written weeks, months or even years ago.
I've seen some code repositories on Internet but never as I would like them to be so I decided to create mine.

Snoopy is an acronym meaning SNipPet repOsitOrY.

This project will use the wonderful control FastColoredTextBox http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/161871/Fast-Colored-TextBox-for-syntax-highlighting# written by Pavel Torgashov http://www.codeproject.com/script/Membership/View.aspx?mid=1005558

Thanks to him for this wonderful work :O)

I've started this project in french so I will upload this project as a reference but I will also create a full english WinForm as well as a WPF application.

This project was started with Visual Studio 2010 and will then be moved to Visual Studio 2012.

The targeted framework is 4.0.
